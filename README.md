# Museum3D-Exhibition

Indoor 3D Exhibition space is an experience that allows you to create, decorate and explore your personal museum.

It was a group project developed for the multimedia systems exams at university of Naples Federico II by the following students:

Alessandro Esposito Vulgo Gigante, Carmine Franzese, Andrea Dinetti.

**Description:**

The goal of this project is the development of a desktop application in Unity 3D for the use of
3D cultural indoor spaces (museums, temporary exhibitions, etc.).
The application consists of two modules, a front end and a back end.

• Back-End
a) The back-end module has the task of allowing the user to draw a compound 3D space
from one or more rooms, with a decent level of customization (colors, floors, lights,
3D objects to place such as plants, walls, etc).
b) Once the 3D space has been designed, it can represent a small museum and/or a location
exhibition for temporary art exhibitions, the application must allow the user to
place 2D and or 3D objects inside the room/rooms. These objects represent the
works of art (sculptures, paintings, etc.).
c) Point closely related to b), the back-end application must allow loading
works of art, each accompanied by a multimedia card composed of text,
images, 3D model, audio files.

• Front-End
The front-end module, having finished the 3D space configuration in the back-end module,
allows the user to enjoy the same personally. The user must be able to
navigate the environment and enjoy the works of art installed. Once close to a work, through
a proximity mechanism, must open a detail sheet of the work of art that allows
the user to enjoy the associated multimedia content.
The goal is to develop a virtual visit in a 3D environment, in the field of Cultural Heritage.
